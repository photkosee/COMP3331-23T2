## Course Summary

This course is an introductory course on computer networks aimed at students with a computer science / electrical engineering background.
We will focus on common paradigms and protocols used in present data communication.
Through lectures, in-class activities, labs and assignments, you will learn the theory and application of:

(1) Medium access control, congestion control, flow control, and reliable transmission,

(2) Addressing and naming,

(3) Routing and switching,

(4) Widely used protocols such as Ethernet, IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.

(5) Special-purpose networks including content delivery, peer-to-peer, and wireless networks, and

(6) Security threats and standard defensive techniques (if time permits)
